## Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a common problem that can have severe financial consequences. This project aims to create machine learning models that can effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Three algorithms have been implemented and compared: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The performance of each model is evaluated to determine their effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains a mix of legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. It is highly imbalanced, with a small number of fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
'
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
'

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
'
pip install -r requirements.txt
'

### 3. Download the dataset (you can find it here) and place it in the data/ directory.

### 4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.

## Usage
The project provides Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for various steps in the process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Here are the primary steps for using this project:

#### 1. Explore the dataset using the credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb notebook.

#### 2. Train and evaluate the machine learning models using the model_training.ipynb notebook or the corresponding scripts.


## Results
The results of the three different models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) are available in the results/ directory. You can find performance metrics, visualizations, and comparisons to assess the effectiveness of each model.
