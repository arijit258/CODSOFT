# Customer Churn Prediction
This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn using three different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical business metric that refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a product or service during a given time period.

## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is a fundamental task for businesses to identify and mitigate potential losses by retaining customers. Machine learning models are powerful tools for predicting customer churn by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that can lead to attrition. In this repository, we implement and compare three popular machine learning algorithms for customer churn prediction: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to size constraints. You can obtain the dataset from [source] and place it in the data/ directory.

## Usage
To use the code and models in this repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/arijit258/customer-churn-prediction.git`

### 2. Install the required dependencies (see Installation).

### 3. Place the dataset in the data/ directory (as described in Dataset).

### 4. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to train and evaluate the models.


## Installation
You need to install the following Python libraries to run the code and notebooks:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. scikit-learn
4. xgboost
5. matplotlib
6. seaborn
7. jupyter

You can install these packages using pip:
`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn jupyter`

## Models
This repository contains three machine learning models for customer churn prediction:

1. Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable linear model that can be used as a baseline for customer churn prediction.

2. Gradient Boosting Classifier: A more complex ensemble model that can capture complex relationships in the data and provide high predictive accuracy.

3. Random Forest Classifier: Another ensemble model that excels at handling non-linearity and high-dimensional data.

Each model is implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook or Python script, and detailed explanations are provided to guide you through the process.

## Results
The results of each model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, are presented in the respective model notebooks or scripts. You can compare the models to determine which one performs best for your specific customer churn prediction task.
