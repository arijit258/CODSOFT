# Customer Churn Prediction
This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn using three different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical business metric that refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a product or service during a given time period.

## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is a fundamental task for businesses to identify and mitigate potential losses by retaining customers. Machine learning models are powerful tools for predicting customer churn by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that can lead to attrition. In this repository, we implement and compare three popular machine learning algorithms for customer churn prediction: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
