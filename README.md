# CODSOFT Internship - Machine Learning Tasks

Welcome to the CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship repository! In this repository, you will find five exciting tasks that will challenge your machine learning skills and help you gain hands-on experience in various aspects of the field. These tasks cover a wide range of topics, from text classification and fraud detection to text generation.

## Task List

1. **Movie Genre Classification**: In this task, you will be working with a dataset of movie descriptions and your goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify movies into their respective genres based on their descriptions. This is a text classification problem that requires you to work with natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: For this task, you will be given a dataset of credit card transactions. Your objective is to create a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent transactions. This task is a binary classification problem with a focus on anomaly detection.

3. **Customer Churn Prediction**: In the context of a telecommunications company, you will work with a dataset containing customer information and their churn status. Your task is to build a predictive model that can identify which customers are likely to churn. This is another binary classification problem.

4. **Spam SMS Detection**: For this task, you will work with a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam (ham). Your goal is to develop a model that can automatically classify incoming SMS messages as spam or ham. This is a text classification problem, similar to Task 1.

5. **Handwritten Text Generation**: In this task, you will dive into the world of deep learning and generative models. You will work with a dataset of handwritten text samples and your objective is to train a model that can generate realistic-looking handwritten text. This task involves sequence generation and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

## Folder Structure

To maintain a structured and organized approach to this internship, we recommend the following folder structure:

```
CODSOFT/
  ├── Movie_Genre_Classification/
  ├── Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection/
  ├── Customer_Churn_Prediction/
  ├── SMS_Spam_Detection/
  ├── Handwritten_Text_Generation/
```

Each task folder should contain the following:

- Jupyter Notebook or Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- A README file explaining the task in detail and the steps taken to solve it.
- Any additional resources, datasets, or information related to the task.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CODSOFT.git
```

2. Navigate to the task directory you wish to work on (e.g., `Task1_Movie_Genre_Classification`).

3. Read the README file in that task's directory for specific instructions, goals, and details on the task.

4. Use Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment to work on the tasks.

5. Complete each task and follow the guidelines provided in the task-specific README files.

6. After completing a task, you can push your work to this repository to showcase your solutions.

## Submission

For submission, please push your completed tasks to this repository as individual folders, and make sure to include your code, documentation, and any additional resources used.
